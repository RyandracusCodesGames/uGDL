## About
The uGDL is the ultimate open-source function library programmed to faciliate the essentials of 2D and 3D graphics programs
designed completely in software with no explicit use of the GPU. Each function was programmed by hand and is able to be manipulated
at the programmer's desire.

The uGDL is capable of drawing 2D shapes, sprites, textures, supports a 2D-animation system, a sprite-based font system capable of supplying a graphics based printf() function,tile-based smooth side scrolling, exporting images, blending colors, sprites, and textures togther, simple UI components, polygonal 3D shapes, and so much more!
