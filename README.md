## About
The uGDL is the ultimate open-source function library complete with a rich set of graphical utility functions programmed to 
facilitate an easy-to-use, lightweight abstraction from the internal details behind how to produce smooth 2D and 3D graphics programs. The uGDL is completely software rendered meaning that there is no explicit use of the GPU, and each function was programmed by hand and able to be changed to fit the needs of the programmer.

The uGDL is currently in active development but is already capable of displaying 2-D shapes, sprites, textures, images, canvases, and animations, and it can even apply some image processing effects onto them such as dithering, blurring, and grayscale. It also has a text component where you can draw characters of strings of text to the display window or use the newly designed Unix-based print and printf functions to format your output to the window. The uGDL has an image library capable of loading and saving images, taking screenshots of the window, and a smooth side-scrolling component to produce parallax effects and the like inspired by the days of the Sega Genesis.
